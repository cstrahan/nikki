windowsDeploy.hs is a script to facilitate deployment on windows.
It tries to copy all needed files into a directory called "nikki".
There are some files of dependencies, that have to be copied.
You can give paths to be searched as command line arguments (space separated).
The script will also look in in dist/build/nikki, dist/build/core and ../ .
