-- | This module defines types and conversion functions
-- for the types used to save levels to files.
-- It employs versioned constructors to allow changes to the file
-- format.
-- If the data structures of the game change,
-- the conversion functions have to be adapted. If this isn't
-- possible with the existing SaveTypes, new versioned constructors
-- have to be added.
